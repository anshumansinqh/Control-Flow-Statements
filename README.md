# LoopsInCpp

**Aim**-To study and implement C++ decision making statement loops

**Theory**:Loops in C++ allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. Common loops include for, while, and do-while. These loops use decision-making to determine whether the loop's body should execute again. By controlling iterations, loops are essential for handling repetitive tasks efficiently in programs.
